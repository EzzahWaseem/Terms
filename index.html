      <p>
        Broad Influence LLC (“Broad Influence,” “we” or “us”) welcomes you. Our
        website is an online marketing platform that, among other things,
        enables content creators (“Creators”) to engage with productions or
        their agents (“Productions”) for the creation and distribution of
        promotional content created by Creators for entertainment productions
        including but not limited to plays, musicals and other performances (the
        “Events”) and other promotional opportunities.

        information about any campaigns that you would run for your Events
        (“Campaigns”). You will also have the opportunity to invite additional
        users to your User Account. If you are a Creator, you will have the
        opportunity to provide us with information regarding your interests,
        upload your media kit and provide us with your payment information.
      </p>
      <p>

      </p>
      <h4>Third Party Sites / Content</h4>
      <p>
        You have the option to register for an account with us by using a
        third-party social networking site, including Facebook, Instagram,
        Twitter and YouTube (the “Third Party Sites”). You also have the option
        to link your account to any such Third Party Sites. You represent that
        you are entitled to disclose your Third Party Site login information to
        us and/or grant us access to your Third Party Site account (including,
        but not limited to, for use for the purposes described herein), without
        breach by you of any of the terms and conditions that govern your use of
        the applicable Third Party Site and without obligating us to pay any
        fees or making us subject to any usage limitations imposed by such Third
        Party Sites. We do not own or control these Third Party Sites. You
        should read the terms of use agreements and privacy policies that apply
        to such Third Party Sites.
      </p>
      <p>
        Your profile on the Service may include information, data, text,
        software, music, sound, photographs, graphics, video, messages, tags
        and/or other materials made accessible by you (“Content”), which
        includes Content from Third Party Sites. When you include Content on the
        Service, you represent and warrant that you have the right, power, and
        authority to include that Content and grant the licenses specified in
        the “Propriety Rights” section below. You further represent and warrant
        that by posting or providing such Content you will not violate
        third-party rights of any kind, including, without limitation, any
        intellectual property rights, rights of publicity, and privacy rights.
        To the extent your Content may be copyrightable, you represent and
        warrant that you own or control all of the copyright rights to such
        Content and that we may exercise the rights to your Content granted
        under these Terms of Use without any liability or obligation for any
        payment.
      </p>
      <h4>Campaigns</h4>
      <p>
        The Service permits Productions to set up Campaigns. Productions may
        view the profiles of Creators and invite a Creator to apply for the
        Campaign. Creators may also browse Campaigns that have been publicly
        posted by Productions and apply for a Campaign through the posting. The
        parties may negotiate the terms of the Campaign by messaging on the
        Service. Once the parties have agreed upon the terms of a Creator’s
        engagement, the Production and Creator may enter into an agreement with
        each other (the “Campaign Agreement”). The Production will have the
        option to use terms suggested by Broad Influence for the Campaign
        Agreement, or upload their own Campaign Agreement.
        <b
          ><i>
            If you are a Production that uses the terms suggested by Broad
            Influence for the Campaign Agreement, or a Creator that agrees to
            any such terms, you acknowledge that (i) Broad Influence is not a
            law firm and may not perform services performed by an attorney, (ii)
            the terms suggested by Broad Influence for a Campaign Agreement are
            not a substitute for the advice or services of an attorney, (iii)
            such terms are not customized to your particular needs, and (iv)
            such terms are not guaranteed to be correct, complete or
            up-to-date.</i
          ></b
        >
        We recommend that each Production and Creator consults a licensed
        attorney in connection with the terms of the Campaign Agreement.
      </p>
      <p>
        You understand that a Creator is performing services for a Production,
        and not Broad Influence, and that Broad Influence is not a party to and
        will be in no way responsible for the performance of either the Creator
        or the Production under any Campaign Agreement. Broad Influence does not
        make any representations or warranties of any kind in respect of a
        Production, Creator or a Campaign Agreement. Each Creator and Production
        agrees to act in good faith when negotiating and performing their
        obligations under each Campaign Agreement.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Service will offer a form W-9 that a Creator may be required to
        complete for a Production. We do not guarantee that this form W-9 is
        up-to-date. If you are a Creator, you are solely responsible for
        ensuring that you are submitting a complete form W-9 that is up-to-date.
      </p>
      <h4>Exclusivity</h4>
      <p>
        We do not allow Creators and Productions to use the Service to contact
        and enter into agreements with each other for Campaigns outside of the
        Service. Additionally, Creators and Productions are not permitted to use
        information obtained from the Service to contact each other about
        Campaigns outside of the Service. If a Creator or Production breaches
        these guidelines, we may limit, restrict or suspend such party from
        using the Service.
      </p>
      <h4>FTC Compliance</h4>
      <p>
        All Creators and Productions are required to comply with the most recent
        Federal Trade Commission Guides Concerning the Use of Testimonials and
        Endorsements in Advertising (“FTC Guides”), including any updates,
        additions, modifications, or supplemental guidance to the FTC Guides, in
        connection with their performance hereunder. We are not responsible for
        and disclaim all liability related to any and all Campaigns,
        Creator-posted information and Production-posted information, including
        compliance with the FTC Guides and other applicable laws.
      </p>
      <h4>Payments</h4>
      <p>
        The Service allows Productions to use Stripe Connect to make payments to
        Creators, and additional processing or application fees may apply if a
        Production chooses to use Stripe Connect. Any use of Stripe is subject
        to the Stripe Connected Account Agreement, available at
        https://stripe.com/us/connect-account/legal. By agreeing to these Terms,
        you agree to be bound by the Stripe Connected Account Agreement, as the
        same may be modified by Stripe from time to time. Additionally, by using
        Stripe, you agree not to use Stripe (and the Service generally) for any
        Prohibited Business purposes, as listed at
        <a href="https://stripe.com/us/prohibited-businesses"
          >https://stripe.com/us/prohibited-businesses.</a
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        The Service also allows Productions to make payments to Creators via
        check. We do not make any representations or warranties as to a
        Production’s payment via check, or the security of any checking account
        or other personal information that any Creator may provide to a
        Production for payment. You agree that we are not responsible for any
        overdraft or failure of a Production to pay with a valid check.
      </p>
      <p>
        Broad Influence is not a trustee or fiduciary of Productions in respect
        of any payments or any Campaign Agreements.
      </p>

        <h4>Accuracy of Service Information</h4>
      <p>The Service contains information provided by third parties (e.g. Creators and Productions), and the opinions and views of third parties.

To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, we are not responsible if information provided by third parties on the Service is not accurate, complete or correct. You acknowledge that we do not edit, modify, filter, screen, monitor, endorse or guarantee information or materials provided by any third party or the content of communications between users. Any reliance on the material on the Service is at your own risk. WE HAVE NO CONTROL OVER THE CONDUCT OF USERS OF THE SERVICE, AND DISCLAIM ALL LIABILITY IN THIS REGARD TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW. 
      </p>
        <h4>Privacy</h4>
      <p>The privacy of your personally identifiable information is very important to us. For more information on what information we collect and how we use and disclose such information, please read our Privacy Policy [insert link].
      </p>
        <h4>No Warranties</h4>
     <p> TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, THE SERVICE, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION ALL CONTENT MADE AVAILABLE ON OR ACCESSED THROUGH THE SERVICE, IS PROVIDED “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE,” WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED. FURTHER, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMISSIBLE BY LAW, WE DISCLAIM ANY AND ALL EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, NON-INFRINGEMENT, TITLE, CUSTOM, TRADE, MERCHANTABILITY, QUIET ENJOYMENT, AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. ALTHOUGH WE SHALL USE REASONABLE CARE AND SKILL TO PROVIDE THE SERVICE TO YOU, WE DO NOT WARRANT THAT THE FUNCTIONS CONTAINED IN THE SERVICE OR ANY MATERIALS OR CONTENT CONTAINED THEREIN WILL BE COMPLETELY SECURE, UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR FREE, THAT DEFECTS WILL BE CORRECTED, OR THAT THE SERVICE OR THE SERVER THAT MAKES IT AVAILABLE IS FREE OF VIRUSES OR OTHER HARMFUL COMPONENTS. 
      </p>
        <h4>Limitation of Liability</h4>
    <p>  TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL WE BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY LOSS OR DAMAGES OF ANY KIND (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, UNDER ANY THEORY OF TORT, CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHER LEGAL OR EQUITABLE THEORY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, ECONOMIC, EXEMPLARY, SPECIAL, PUNITIVE, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL LOSSES OR DAMAGES, LOST PROFITS, LOST DATA, LOST OPPORTUNITIES, COSTS OF COVER, OR PERSONAL INJURY/WRONGFUL DEATH) THAT ARE DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY RELATED TO: (I) THE SERVICE; (II) ANY CONTENT OR THIRD PARTY SERVICE THAT IS INTEGRATED INTO THE SERVICE OR MADE AVAILABLE ON THE SERVICE; (III) ANY CAMPAIGN AGREEMENT, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION THE TERMS SUGGESTED BY US FOR THE CAMPAIGN AGREEMENT; OR (IV) YOUR ACCESS TO OR USE OF, OR INABILITY TO ACCESS OR USE, THE SERVICE. 
      </p>
     <p>   IF WE ARE FOUND TO BE LIABLE TO YOU IN ANY MANNER, THEN TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW OUR AGGREGATE LIABILITY FOR ALL CLAIMS UNDER SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES FOR LIABILITIES, SHALL NOT EXCEED ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS ($100.00). 
     </p>
     <p>   NOTHING IN THESE TERMS OF USE LIMITS OR EXCLUDES OUR LIABILITY TO YOU FOR: (A) FRAUD OR FRAUDULENT MISREPRESENTATION; (B) DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY CAUSED BY OUR NEGLIGENCE; OR (C) ANY OTHER LIABILITY WHICH CANNOT BE LIMITED OR EXCLUDED AS A MATTER OF LAW.
      </p>
        <h4>Indemnity</h4>
     <p> You agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless Broad Influence, its officers, directors, employees, business partners and agents, from and against, or reimburse us for, any and all claims, damages, obligations, losses, liabilities, costs or debt, and expenses (including but not limited to attorney’s fees) arising out of or in connection with any of the following: (i) your breach of these Terms of Use; (ii) your access to or use of the Service; (iii) your violation of any third-party right, including without limitation any intellectual property right, publicity, confidentiality, property or privacy right, or any agreement or terms with a third party to which you are subject; (iv) your violation of any laws, rules, regulations, codes, statutes, ordinances or orders of any governmental and quasi-governmental authorities, including, without limitation, all regulatory, administrative and legislative authorities; or (v) any misrepresentation made by you. You will cooperate as fully required by Broad Influence in the defense of any claim. We reserve the right to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter subject to indemnification by you, and you may not in any event settle any claim without our prior written consent.
      </p>
     <h4>   Binding Arbitration and Class Action Waiver</h4>
      <p>You and Broad Influence agree to arbitrate all disputes between you and Broad Influence, except disputes relating to the enforcement of Broad Influence’s intellectual property rights.  Under such circumstances, we may bring a lawsuit solely for injunctive relief to stop unauthorized use or abuse of the Service, or intellectual property infringement (for example, trademark, trade secret, copyright, or patent rights) without first engaging in arbitration or the informal dispute-resolution process described below. 
     </p>
       <p> In the event of a dispute, you or Broad Influence must send to the other party a notice of dispute, which is a written statement that sets forth the name, address and contact information of the party giving the notice, the facts giving rise to the dispute and the relief requested.  You must send any notice of dispute to <a href="mailto:support@broadinfluence.com.  ">support@broadinfluence.com.</a>  We will send any notice of dispute to you at the contact information we have for you. You and Broad Influence will attempt to resolve a dispute through informal negotiation within sixty (60) days from the date the notice of dispute is sent.  After sixty (60) days, you or we may commence arbitration.  You may also litigate a dispute in small claims court if the dispute meets the requirements to be heard in small claims court, whether or not you negotiated informally first.
      </p>
      <p>  If you and Broad Influence do not resolve a dispute by informal negotiation or in small claims court, the dispute shall be settled by binding arbitration before a neutral arbitrator whose decision will be final except for a limited right of appeal under the U.S. Federal Arbitration Act.  The arbitration shall be administered by JAMS pursuant to its Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures and in accordance with the Expedited Procedures in those Rules or pursuant to JAMS' Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures. If there is a conflict between JAMS Rules and the rules set forth in these Terms of Use, the rules set forth in these Terms of Use will govern. The JAMS Rules and instructions for how to initiate an arbitration are available from JAMS at <a href="http://www.jamsadr.com">http://www.jamsadr.com </a> or 1-800-352-5267. 
     </p>
     <p>   Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the JAMS Rules. Each party will bear their own costs of arbitration unless the arbitrator directs that bearing such costs would be an undue burden and in that case, we will pay for your portion of the arbitration administrative costs (but not your attorneys’ fees). Arbitration under this contract shall be held in the United States in the borough of Manhattan, New York, New York, United States of America, without regard to its conflict of laws provisions. If travelling to the borough of Manhattan, New York, New York, United States of America, is a burden, you may participate in the arbitration by phone or via document submission to the fullest extent allowable by the arbitrator. Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.
      </p>
      <p>  The arbitrator will decide the rights and liabilities, if any, of you and Broad Influence, and the dispute will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties. The arbitrator shall have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim. The arbitrator shall have the authority to award monetary damages and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual under applicable law, the JAMS Rules, and these Terms of Use. The arbitrator shall issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded. The arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have. The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and us.
     </p>
     <p>   You may only resolve disputes with us on an individual basis, and may not bring a claim as a plaintiff or a class member in a class, consolidated, or representative action. Class arbitrations, class actions, private attorney general actions, and consolidation with other arbitrations are not allowed.
      </p>
      <p>  THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY, instead electing that all claims and disputes shall be resolved by arbitration, except as otherwise expressly set forth herein. In the event any litigation should arise between you and us in any state or federal court in a suit to vacate or enforce an arbitration award or otherwise, YOU AND BROAD INFLUENCE WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL, instead electing that the dispute be resolved by a judge. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE BEEN ADVISED THAT YOU MAY CONSULT WITH AN ATTORNEY IN DECIDING TO ACCEPT THIS CONTRACT TO ARBITRATE.
     </p>
       <h4> Choice of Forum</h4>
      <p>You agree that any action at law or in equity arising out of or relating to these Terms of Use or the Service that is not subject to arbitration shall be filed, and that venue properly lies, only in the state or federal courts located in the borough of Manhattan, New York, New York, United States of America and you consent and submit to the personal jurisdiction of such courts for the purposes of litigating such action.
